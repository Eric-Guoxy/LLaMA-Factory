First, I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0,3) to polar coordinates. Polar coordinates are represented as (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis.

To find r, I can use the Pythagorean theorem since the point is (0,3). The distance from the origin to the point is the square root of (0 squared plus 3 squared), so r = √(0² + 3²) = √9 = 3. Therefore, r is 3.

Next, I need to find θ. Since the point is (0,3), it's on the positive y-axis. The angle θ for the positive y-axis is π/2 radians. So, θ is π/2.

Putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2).

The rectangular coordinates are (0,3). To convert this to polar coordinates (r, θ):

1. **Calculate r**:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine θ**:
   Since the point is (0,3), it lies on the positive y-axis. Therefore, θ is:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

**Final Answer**:
\[
\boxed{\left(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\]
