This involves analyzing, summarizing, exploring, reassessing, and refining your thought process through multiple iterations. Structure your response into two sections: Thought and Solution. In the Thought section, present your reasoning using the format: "<think>

To convert the point \((0, 3)\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates \((r, \theta)\), we can use the following formulas:

1. \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \)
2. \( \theta = \begin{cases} 
   \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) & \text{if } x > 0 \\
   \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) + \pi & \text{if } x < 0 \text{ and } y \ge 0 \\
   \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) + 2\pi & \text{if } x < 0 \text{ and } y < 0 \\
   \frac{\pi}{2} & \text{if } x = 0 \text{ and } y > 0 \\
   \frac{3\pi}{2} & \text{if } x = 0 \text{ and } y < 0 \\
   \text{undefined} & \text{if } x = 0 \text{ and } y = 0 
\end{cases} \)

Given the point \((0, 3)\):

- \( x = 0 \)
- \( y = 3 \)

Let's calculate \( r \) and \( \theta \) using these formulas. 

First, we calculate \( r \):

\[ r = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} \]

Next, we determine \( \theta \):

Since \( x = 0 \) and \( y > 0 \), we have:

\[ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \]

Let's use Python to confirm these calculations.
```python
import math

# Given rectangular coordinates
x = 0
y = 3

# Calculate r
r = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)

# Calculate theta
theta = math.atan2(y, x)

# Convert theta to the range [0, 2*pi)
if theta < 0:
    theta += 2 * math.pi

print(((r, theta)))
```
```output
(3.0, 1.5707963267948966)
```
The calculations confirm that the polar coordinates for the point \((0, 3)\) are:

\[ r = 3.0 \]
\[ \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.5708 \]

Thus, the polar coordinates are:

\[
\boxed{(3.0, \frac{\pi}{2})}
\]
