Okay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinate point (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, polar coordinates are (r, θ), right? Where r is the radius or the distance from the origin, and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. Let me think step by step.

First, to find r, I remember the formula is r = √(x² + y²). Here, the point is (0, 3), so x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging those into the formula: r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. So r is 3. That part seems straightforward.

Now, θ. The angle θ is a bit trickier because depending on the quadrant where the point is, the angle might be different. But in this case, the point is (0, 3). Let me visualize the coordinate plane. The x-coordinate is 0, which means it's on the y-axis. Since the y-coordinate is positive (3), the point is on the positive y-axis. 

In terms of angles, the positive y-axis is at 90 degrees, or π/2 radians. So θ should be π/2. Let me double-check. If θ is measured from the positive x-axis, moving counterclockwise, then the positive y-axis is indeed π/2. The point (0, 3) is exactly there, so θ is π/2. 

Wait, but sometimes people get confused between radians and degrees. But since the problem doesn't specify, and usually in higher mathematics, angles are in radians unless stated otherwise. So π/2 radians is correct here. Also, the angle needs to be between 0 and 2π. π/2 is within that range, so that's good.

Let me just recap. The rectangular coordinates are (0, 3). The radius r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which gives 3. The angle θ is determined by the direction from the origin, which in this case is straight up along the y-axis, so θ is π/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, π/2). 

I think that's it. Let me check if there's any other consideration. For example, if the point were (0, -3), then θ would be 3π/2. But since it's (0, 3), positive y-axis, θ is π/2. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is (3, π/2).

**Final Answer**
The polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are \boxed{\left(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}.
</think>

To convert the rectangular coordinate point \((0, 3)\) to polar coordinates, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the radius \(r\)**:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine the angle \(\theta\)**:
   - The point \((0, 3)\) lies on the positive \(y\)-axis.
   - The angle from the positive \(x\)-axis to the positive \(y\)-axis is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians.

Thus, the polar coordinates of the point \((0, 3)\) are \(\boxed{\left(3, \dfrac{\pi}{2}\right)}\).
