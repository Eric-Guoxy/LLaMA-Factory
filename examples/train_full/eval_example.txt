Alright, so I have to convert the rectangular coordinates (0,3) to polar coordinates. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r,θ), where r is the distance from the origin and θ is the angle made with the positive x-axis.

First, I need to find r. I recall the formula for converting from rectangular (x,y) to polar (r,θ): r = √(x² + y²). Plugging in the values, x is 0 and y is 3. So r = √(0² + 3²) = √(0 + 9) = √9 = 3. That seems straightforward.

Next, I need to find θ. The formula for θ is θ = arctan(y/x). Again, plugging in the values, y is 3 and x is 0. So θ = arctan(3/0). Hmm, division by zero is undefined. I need to think about what arctan does when x is 0. 

From what I remember, arctan(∞) is π/2, and arctan(-∞) is -π/2. But in this case, y is positive and x is 0. Since x is 0 and y is positive, the point lies on the positive y-axis. The angle for the positive y-axis is π/2 radians. So θ is π/2.

Wait, but let me confirm this. When x is 0, and y is positive, the angle is indeed π/2. If y were negative, it would be -π/2 or 3π/2, but since y is positive here, it's π/2.

Putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, π/2). I think that's correct. But just to be thorough, I'll double-check the formulas. Yes, r is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides x and y, so √(0² + 3²) is definitely 3. And θ is the angle whose tangent is y/x, which is 3/0, undefined, so it must be π/2.

So, the final answer is (3, π/2).

To convert the rectangular coordinates (0,3) to polar coordinates, we use the following steps:

1. **Calculate the radius \( r \):**
   \[
   r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
   \]

2. **Determine the angle \( \theta \):**
   Since \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 3 \), the point lies on the positive y-axis. The angle \( \theta \) is therefore:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]

Thus, the polar coordinates are:
\[
\boxed{\left(3, \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\]
