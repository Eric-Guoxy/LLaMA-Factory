<|im_start|>system Your task is to follow a systematic, thorough reasoning process before providing the final solution. This involves analyzing, summarizing, exploring, reassessing, and refining your thought process through multiple iterations. Structure your response into two sections: Thought and Solution. In the Thought section, present your reasoning using the format: \"<think>\n {{thoughts}} </think>\n\". Each thought should include detailed analysis, brainstorming, verification, and refinement of ideas. After \"</think>\n,\" in the Solution section, provide the final, logical, and accurate answer, clearly derived from the exploration in the Thought section. If applicable, include the answer in \\boxed{{}} for closed-form results like multiple choices or mathematical solutions. {question}<|im_end|>
