                "content": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the probability that exactly two of the three sleepers are from the same country, and the third is from a different country. The delegates are from Mexico (2 officials), Canada (3 officials), and the United States (4 officials), making a total of 9 delegates. The answer should be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.\n\nFirst, let's recall that probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So I need to compute both the total number of ways three delegates can fall asleep and the number of ways that exactly two are from the same country and one is from another.\n\nTotal number of possible outcomes: This is the combination of 9 delegates taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!). So, C(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * 6!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 84. So total possible outcomes are 84.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are the cases where exactly two are from the same country and the third is from a different country. To compute this, I need to consider each country separately and calculate the number of ways two delegates can be chosen from that country and one from another country. Then sum all these possibilities.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch here. The problem states \"exactly two of the sleepers are from the same country\". This implies that exactly one country contributes two sleepers, and the third sleeper is from another country. So we have to avoid cases where all three are from the same country because that would be three from the same country, not two. Also, we need to avoid cases where all three are from different countries. So the favorable cases are exactly two from one country and one from another.\n\nTherefore, we can compute the number of favorable outcomes by considering each country as the possible contributor of the two sleepers and then multiply by the number of ways to choose two from that country and one from the remaining countries. Then sum over all three countries.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check which countries can actually contribute two sleepers. For Mexico, there are only 2 officials. So the maximum number of sleepers from Mexico can be 2. For Canada, there are 3 officials, so they can contribute up to 3 sleepers, but we are looking for cases where exactly two are from the same country. Similarly, the US has 4 officials.\n\nTherefore, Mexico can only contribute two sleepers at most, but since we need exactly two from the same country, Mexico can be a candidate for the two sleepers. Canada can also contribute two, but since they have three delegates, the number of ways to choose two is C(3,2). Similarly, the US can contribute two in C(4,2) ways. Then, for each country, after choosing two delegates, we need to choose the third delegate from the remaining countries.\n\nSo let's break this down:\n\n1. Two from Mexico and one from another country.\n2. Two from Canada and one from another country.\n3. Two from the US and one from another country.\n\nWe need to calculate each of these three scenarios and then add them up.\n\nStarting with Mexico:\n\nNumber of ways to choose two from Mexico: C(2, 2) = 1.\n\nThen, the third delegate must be from Canada or the US. Since there are 3 + 4 = 7 delegates from other countries.\n\nSo total for Mexico case: 1 * 7 = 7.\n\nNext, Canada:\n\nNumber of ways to choose two from Canada: C(3, 2) = 3.\n\nThen, the third delegate must be from Mexico or the US. There are 2 + 4 = 6 delegates from other countries.\n\nTotal for Canada case: 3 * 6 = 18.\n\nThen, the US:\n\nNumber of ways to choose two from the US: C(4, 2) = 6.\n\nThen, the third delegate must be from Mexico or Canada. There are 2 + 3 = 5 delegates from other countries.\n\nTotal for US case: 6 * 5 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the total favorable outcomes are 7 (Mexico) + 18 (Canada) + 30 (US) = 55.\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Is that correct? So 7 + 18 + 30 equals 55? 7+18 is 25, and 25 +30 is 55. Yes. So 55 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 55/84. But we need to check if this fraction is reduced. 55 and 84. Let's see. The prime factors of 55 are 5 and 11. The prime factors of 84 are 2, 2, 3, 7. So they have no common factors. Therefore, 55/84 is already in reduced terms. Therefore, m = 55, n =84. So m +n=55+84=139.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Wait, I need to verify if that's correct. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"exactly two of the sleepers are from the same country\". So, in other words, exactly one pair from the same country and the third from another. So, in that case, the calculation is correct. Because each case (Mexico, Canada, US) is being considered where two are from one country and the third is from another. So summing up all three gives the total number of favorable cases.\n\nBut let me cross-verify this with another approach. Alternatively, compute the probability by subtracting the probabilities of the other cases. The total probability is 1. The other cases are: all three from the same country, or all three from different countries.\n\nBut maybe that's more complicated, but let's try.\n\nFirst, compute the total number of ways: 84, as before.\n\nCompute the number of ways where all three are from the same country. For that, check each country:\n\nMexico: C(2,3). But Mexico only has 2 delegates, so C(2,3)=0.\n\nCanada: C(3,3)=1.\n\nUS: C(4,3)=4.\n\nTherefore, total all-three-from-same-country cases: 0 +1 +4=5.\n\nThen, compute the number of ways where all three are from different countries. The delegates are from three countries. So we need one from Mexico, one from Canada, and one from the US.\n\nNumber of ways: C(2,1)*C(3,1)*C(4,1) =2*3*4=24.\n\nTherefore, the remaining cases (which should be our favorable cases) are total - all same - all different: 84 -5 -24=55. Which matches the previous number. Therefore, the favorable cases are indeed 55. Hence, probability is 55/84, which reduces to 55/84. So m +n=139.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once again if 55 and 84 are coprime. The prime factors of 55 are 5 and 11. 84 factors into 2^2 *3 *7. No common factors. So yes, 55/84 is reduced. So the answer is 139.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the probability step by step again.\n\nFirst, total combinations: C(9,3)=84.\n\nFavorable cases: For exactly two from one country and one from another.\n\nCase 1: Two from Mexico (2C2=1) and one from another (7C1=7). Total 1*7=7.\n\nCase 2: Two from Canada (3C2=3) and one from another (6C1=6). Total 3*6=18.\n\nCase3: Two from US (4C2=6) and one from another (5C1=5). Total 6*5=30.\n\nTotal favorable:7+18+30=55. Therefore, probability=55/84=55/84. Hence, m +n=139. So the answer is 139.\n\nBut let me see if there's any other angle. Let's suppose we consider the probability as:\n\nProbability = (number of ways two from a country and one from another) / total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using probabilities multiplied. But combinations are straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, compute the probability step by step:\n\nFirst, pick the first delegate. Then, pick the second, third, but since order doesn't matter, it's more complicated. The combination approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, hypergeometric distribution? Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut the combination approach seems correct, and cross-verified by the complementary counting. So 55/84 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 55 +84=139.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{139}\n</think>\n\nTo find the probability that exactly two of the three sleepers are from the same country, we start by calculating the total number of ways to choose 3 delegates out of 9. This is given by the combination formula:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3!(9-3)!} = 84\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the number of favorable outcomes where exactly two delegates are from one country and the third is from another. We break this down by each country:\n\n1. **Mexico**: There are 2 officials. The number of ways to choose 2 from Mexico and 1 from another country:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{2}{2} \\times \\binom{7}{1} = 1 \\times 7 = 7\n   \\]\n\n2. **Canada**: There are 3 officials. The number of ways to choose 2 from Canada and 1 from another country:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{6}{1} = 3 \\times 6 = 18\n   \\]\n\n3. **United States**: There are 4 officials. The number of ways to choose 2 from the US and 1 from another country:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{4}{2} \\times \\binom{5}{1} = 6 \\times 5 = 30\n   \\]\n\nSumming these favorable outcomes, we get:\n\\[\n7 + 18 + 30 = 55\n\\]\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{55}{84}\n\\]\n\nSince 55 and 84 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form. Therefore, \\( m = 55 \\) and \\( n = 84 \\), and the sum \\( m + n \\) is:\n\\[\n55 + 84 = 139\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{139}\n\\]",
